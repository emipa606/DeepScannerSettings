Through the settings menu you can set the following characteristics of each deep ore in your game (including mods.)



- **Commonality:** how rare or common a resource should be compared to other resources. A weighted scale.
- **Resource amount:** set how much of each ore your colonists dig up each digging cycle.
- **Vein size:** alter how small or big the size of each ore vein can be
